# What is Howl Slack ?

HowlSlack is a bot that watches a channel's messages and read out them louds.
We use it at work to make announcements through offices ! Each office has a small Raspberry PI connected to speakers which runs Howl Slack.

We connected some endpoints of our API to Slack through Zappier. For example when someone orders something we have a message sent to Slack and then Howl Slack reads it and everyone hears:

```
ðŸ”Š Foo bar just ordered <something> for <that> amount of money ! Good Job !
```

There is pretty fun use cases for this ! As you can connect a lot of things to Slack but also you can type yourself messages.

```
ðŸ”Š John, you're fired
ðŸ”Š Just kidding
```
